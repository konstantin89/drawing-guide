Notes
=====

General process:

	When sculpting, start shaping the large shapes in low polygon count, 
	then when starting refining the small ditails use the divide command.
	Create the siluet to look closest to the goal with the smallest ammount of poligons.

	move perpendicular to the surface - hold alt while in move brash

	lazy mouse - 'Stroke'->'Lazy Mouse'. Edit only 'Lazy Radius'.

	to break 'perfect smooth surfaces' and make them more organic, use the 'add clay' brush.

Brushes:

	morph brush - first use 'Morth Target'->'Store MT', then use Morth brush to restore the stored state.
	
	use 'Dam standard' brash to make deep and thin cuts.

	use 'Trim Dynamic' brush to create edges on round objects.

	use 'Move Topological' to shape large shapes. Its better than normal move.

	use 'Nudge' brush to slide edges around, without changing the topology.

Alphas:

	To make alphas smoother, edit Alpha->Modify->blur.

	Setting 'Focal Shift' to -100, will remove the alpha's edges 'fade out'.

	To make alpha blend better on to the surface, use Alpha->Modify->MidValue (set to 100).

Masks:

	To activate mask press ctrl.
	
	To 'reverse' the mask, hold ctrl and click anywhere not on model.

	ctrl + left click + drag will clear all the mask.
	
	Use 'Masking'->'Blur Mask' and 'Masking'->'Sharp Mask' to manipulate mask's edges.
	
	Use 'Masking'->'Grow Mask' and 'Masking'->'Srink Mask' to manipulate mask size.	
	
	
Hide/Show:

	Press 'Ctrl+Shift+Drag' to show only part of the object. Press 'Ctrl+Shift+R_click' to show all.
	
	Press 'Ctrl+Shift+Drag+Alt' to hide part of the object.
	
	Reverse hide selection by 'Ctrl+Shift+Drag', while dragging on empty space.
	
	Use 'Trim Rect' brush to trim parts of the shape while using the (Ctrl+Alt+Drag) (instead of hide/show).
	
	The Trim brushes are working in select mode (ctrl+alt).
	
	Trim cannot work if there are subdivisions! Use Clip brushes instead. They keep the topology.
