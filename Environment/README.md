# Enviroment Design

## Line Wight

There are 3 main line types:

Thumb rule for line usage:  
`Thin` lines are lines that are not visible.  
`Gray` lines are lines for edges that the ant can goes over, and remain visible.  
`Black` lines are for edges that if the ant goes over them, it will be not visible.

## Prespective

The most common `vanishing points` configuration is using two vanishing points.  
To find the `horizon line`, look for horisontal objects in the scene.  
Here are some examples of scenes with two vanishing points:

### Perspective grid 
`Perspective grid` can be used to simplify the drawing.  

How perspective grid is created:

Here is an example of perspective grid usage:

### Perspective multiplying
You can create plains on perspective from already existing plain.  
In the following example, plain A has the same size as plain B:

### Perspective dividing
You can divide perspective plains to smaller plains:

## Rendering

`Half To Black` is technique to find the correct values of shadows.  
`Ambient Occlusion Shadows` are shadows on form ends.  

### Spheres and Cubes

## Colors

`Prime Color` is color that is not a combination of other colors.  

`Complimentry Colors` are colors that oppose each other on the color weel.  
For example: Green and Red are complimentry colors.

### Light Shadow Contrust 
`Light Shadow Contrust` is acheved in two ways:  
1. Cool light + warm shadow.  
2. Warm light + cool shadow.  

This contrust is making the painting more alive and colorful.

#### Bush example  
This example is good demonstration of light/shadow contrast.   
The light is warm yellow.  
The shadow is cool blue.
